## Filtering columns and rows

Using SQL you can both filter and order data in a table.

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)

library(sqldf)
```


Supose now  I would like to see the homerun totals for the 1927 Yankees. I could write the following query:

```{r}

query <-"select playerID,yearID,teamID,hr from Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)

Finding the players with the most home runs is easy using the following code 

query<-"Select playerID, yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting 
WHERE HR>50
ORDER BY HR DESC"

sqldf(query)
